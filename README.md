# Turborepo Starter

Welcome to the Turborepo starter project!

This repository includes a Turborepo setup with various applications and packages, designed to manage a monorepo efficiently.

## Contents

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application for documentation.
- `web`: Another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application for your main site.
- `@repo/ui`: A shared React component library used by both `web` and `docs` applications.
- `@repo/eslint-config`: ESLint configurations, including `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`.
- `@repo/typescript-config`: TypeScript configurations (`tsconfig.json`) used across the monorepo.

### Utilities

This Turborepo comes with several tools pre-configured:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
````

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

### Development

To develop all apps and packages, run:

```sh
bun run dev
```

This command will start all applications and monitor changes.

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run:

```sh
bun run build
```

### Database Migrations

To handle database migrations, you can use the following scripts:

- **Generate Prisma Client:** `bun run db:generate`
- **Push Prisma Schema to Database:** `bun run db:push`
- **Run Migrations in Development:** `bun run db:migrate:dev`
- **Deploy Migrations:** `bun run db:migrate`

You can use these commands to manage your database schema and migrations across the monorepo.

### Remote Caching

To enable remote caching with Turborepo, you'll need a Vercel account. Follow these steps:

1. Authenticate with Vercel:

   ```sh
   npx turbo login
   ```

2. Link your Turborepo to the remote cache:
   ```sh
   npx turbo link
   ```
